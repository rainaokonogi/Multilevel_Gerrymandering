To create the building blocks for this experiment, do the following:

First, run the following in the command line:
    PYTHONHASHSEED=0 uv run make_grid_maps.py.
This should instantly create the nine grid maps.

If using a cluster, then type the following into the command line:
1. bash make_building_blocks_files_cluster.sh
2. bash add_init_parts_to_blocks_cluster.sh

If not using a cluster, run the following:
1. make_building_blocks_files.sh
2. add_init_parts_to_blocks.sh

After you have created or downloaded the building blocks, do the following:
